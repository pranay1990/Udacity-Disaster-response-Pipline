# Project Name- Disaster Response Pipeline

This is my first Data Science Nanodegree program project

## Table of contents
1) categories.csv
2) messages.csv
3) ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb
4) Disaster_Response_Database.db
5) ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb
6) workspace folder

## Installation
You need to install the following libraries,
1) NLTK
2) Numpy
3) Pandas
4) sklearn
5) matplotlib

## Project Motivation
In the project, we will find a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. I have created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. 

## Description of the files
**Readme.md** : description of the repository

**messages.csv** : contains the messaged id and respective messages.

**categories.csv** : contains the messaged id and categories of the messages.

**ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb** :  This file Extract, Transform and load the cleaned data.

**Disaster_Response_Database.db** : This is the database where the cleaned data is stored.

**ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb** : In this file we develop and test different machine learning algorithm for classifying those messages into the multi label categories.

***workspace folder*** : It contains the web app version of the code
